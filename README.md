Started doing daily [LeetCode challenges](https://leetcode.com/u/esoltys/) and I'm ranking in the Top 7% so far. They're great as a daily puzzle kind of challenge, but I think it's complete nonsense as part of a technical interview. You're not testing how someone tackles a problem. You're testing to see if they've participated in coding competitions. You're skewing your interview towards young devs fresh from school who are used to frequent testing. Nothing in these competitions have anything to do with the day-to-day work of an experienced developer.

I recently worked on a series of small weather-related code experiments, dedicating my mornings or afternoons to them. I explored various data store APIs like OpenWeatherMap, Copernicus Data Store (CDS), and the NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO). Additionally, I experimented with visualizers such as Chart.js, Apache ECharts, and Esri ArcGIS. You'll find them pinned below.
